      infrastructure for decentralized ETH staking.</>,

    question: <>How long will this upgrade last?</>,

      many times as they would like.</>,

    question: <>What is the conversion rate?</>,
    answer: <>CDT tokens will be upgraded to SSV tokens based on a predetermined fixed rate of 1 CDT = 0.01 SSV.</>,

    question: <>Can I revert my tokens back to CDT?</>,
    answer: <>No, the SSV upgrade is final and irreversible. Once upgraded you will not be able to retrieve your
      original CDT tokens; after carrying out the transaction the upgrade is final.</>,

  {
    question: <>How are exchanges handling the upgrade?</>,
    answer: (
      <>
        The upgrade interface only helps users upgrade CDT tokens held in self-custody wallets (such as Metamask for
        example).
        <br /><br />
        If you hold CDT in other exchanges (centralized or decentralized) or any other platform where you do not control
        the private keys to the wallet - you wonâ€™t be able to upgrade your CDT automatically. Your alternative is
        withdrawing your funds to your personal wallet, and then upgrading your CDT manually through the dedicated
        interface.
        <br /><br />
        Please note: do not transfer the new SSV tokens to a centralized exchange unless the exchange is already
        providing support for the new SSV token.

    answer: (
